# Vuenique

Vuenique is a low-level component visualization library that utilizes Vue's use of a virtual DOM to bring the power of D3 to Vue without competiton for the DOM.


Current features include:
* High utility chart types such as bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots
* Primitive components built around Vue and D3
* Utility-first approach that allows you to customize visuals as needed
* Declarative components that are simple and logical to use
